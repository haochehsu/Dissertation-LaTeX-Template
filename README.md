# Dissertation LaTeX Template

This double-spaced template is based on the [Dissertation Formatting Manual](https://guides.lib.uci.edu/gradmanual/home)[^1] from the UC-Irvine Libraries. The design uses the [arXiv style](https://github.com/kourgeorge/arxiv-style) which is based on the [NeurIPS](https://nips.cc/) styling. The reference style includes [AEA](https://github.com/ShiroTakeda/econ-bst/blob/master/customization/econ-aea.bst) (lastname, firstname) and [Econometrica](https://github.com/ShiroTakeda/econ-bst/blob/master/customization/econ-econometrica.bst) (lastname, abbreviated firstname).

Based on the NIPS styling, it makes this dissertation template esthetic and convenient for reading. Instead of integrating the formatting into a single style file, this template defines the styles and format in the `main.tex` preambles and collects all the imported packages in the `package.sty` making the source more transparent and easier to customize.

Various LaTeX syntaxes are also demonstrated throughout the document such as spacing, hyperlinked footers, abbreviations, coloring, listing, table-of-contents customization, hyper-referencing, figure and table formatting with decimal alignment, mathematics symbols, and graphic elements. Users can refer to the syntax during editing.
